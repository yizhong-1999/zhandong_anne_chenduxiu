  We intend to leverage ChatGPT to detect changes in Chen’s thinking about the theory and practice of Marxism and Communism. Through embedding and prompt engineering, we plan to extract topic sentences, generate summary statements and estimate topic opinions on these summaries. Our work introduces two key innovations: 1) the utilization of advanced AI methodologies grounded in extensive language models, as opposed to traditional statistical techniques that often relied on oversimplified assumptions, and 2) an extension of our analysis to sentences rather than individual words, allowing for richer contextual understanding.

## Introduction

In our 2021 paper, “Network of Words: A Co-Occurrence Analysis of Nation-Building Terms in the Writings of Liang Qichao and Chen Duxiu,” (Journal of Historical Network Research, 5:154-185), we created a word co-occurrence network to plot the relationship between selected words, in order to compare different interpretations of terms such as “democracy,” “constitutionalism,” and “citizen” in the writings of two famous Chinese intellectuals of early Republican China.

We now propose to re-examine the writings of Chen Duxiu (1879-1942), the co-founder of the Chinese Communist Party, by using the innovative Large Language Models (LLMs)  LLMA and ChatGPT[@ChatGPT].  We intend to leverage ChatGPT to detect changes in Chen’s thinking about the theory and practice of Marxism and Communism. Through embedding and prompt engineering, we plan to extract topic sentences, generate summary statements and estimate topic opinions on these summaries. Our work introduces two key innovations: 1) the utilization of advanced AI methodologies grounded in extensive language models, as opposed to traditional statistical techniques that often relied on oversimplified assumptions, and 2) an extension of our analysis to sentences rather than individual words, allowing for richer contextual understanding. 
A brief biography of Chen Duxiu is as follows: As a young boy Chen chafed against the traditional preparation to study for the all-important civil service exam. He deplored the ineffectiveness of gaining governmental positions through rote memorization of ancient classics. Surprisingly he placed first in the entry level of this exam. Soon Chen left to study in Japan, where he first encountered Western democratic philosophies such as those of John Stuart Mills, Jean Jacques Rousseau and Montesquieu. He concluded that the only way to save China was to overthrow the dynasty. Returning to China in 1903 he joined an assassination squad and published newspapers rallying his countrymen to fight foreign imperialism and to overthrow the dynasty. One of his journals, called Xin Qingnian 新青年 [New Youth], whose contributors ultimately consisted of some of the most respected and celebrated scholars and intellectuals of the time, made Chen a celebrated public intellectual. Together these authors pushed through the national language reform, denounced the restrictive Confucian ethos, and advocated scientific thinking, democracy, and individual freedom. 
With the disappointing outcome from the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, whereby China’s hope to recover German occupied Shandong peninsula was dashed, Chen and many of his colleagues became disillusioned with Western style democracy. Within two years, Chen co-founded the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) with the help of Russian Comintern agents and turned his attention to political activism. Politics proved to be treacherous, however, and Chen was scapegoated for the failure of Comintern policies in China and ousted from the CCP in 1929. He was jailed by Chiang Kai-shek, head of the Nationalist Party (GMD), from 1932-1937, and released from prison at the onset of the Resist Japan war. Distancing himself from both the CCP and the GMD, Chen became a political pariah whose writings few dared to publish. Undaunted, he continued to comment on the state of Chinese politics and died in penurious circumstances in 1942. 

What were Chen’s final views on Western democracy, capitalism, and communism? In his youthful optimism, he declared France to have gifted humanity with three powerful concepts: human rights, evolutionary theory, and socialism.  Caught in the power struggle between Stalin and Trotsky, Chen lost his political leadership. Tragically he also lost two of his sons at the hands of the GMD. Did the vicissitudes of life affect his thinking?  We turn to his essays to find out. 


## Methodology:

The central objective is to compare the efficacy of our earlier co-occurrence network methodology with the novel ChatGPT approach. We seek the best method to detect Chen’s ideological evolution over time. We used the corpus of Chen’s writing, consisting of 892 articles and 1,347,699 characters.  From this collection we selected fifteen articles that were salient in his thoughts on political theory, written in the years 1914-1940.  

## Quarto Usage

For advanced users, we recommend exploring features as **Code Blocks**: Use triple backticks (```) to create code blocks. Specify the language for syntax highlighting (e.g., ```python`). Quarto lets you run code and embed its output directly into your document. See <https://quarto.org/docs/computations/inline-code.html> for guidance.

```{python}
#| output: false
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Create some simple synthetic historical data
np.random.seed(0)
years = pd.date_range('1900-01-01', periods=120, freq='Y')
values = np.random.normal(loc=0, scale=1, size=120).cumsum()

data = pd.DataFrame({
    'Year': years.year,
    'Value': values
})

# Save the data to a CSV file
data.to_csv('data/sample_data.csv', index=False)
```

```{python}
#| label: fig-plots
# Plotting the data
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(data['Year'], data['Value'], marker='o')
plt.title('Synthetic Historical Data')
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('Value')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```
